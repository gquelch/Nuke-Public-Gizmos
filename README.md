# Nuke-Public-Tools
My custom gizmos for Nuke.
These are provided as .nk files rather than .gizmo as they are easier to edit, share and import into Nuke.

## LightWrap_GQ

I find the default Lightwrap node frustrating as it messes with other channels if used in the main pipe. My node only affects RGB channels so you no longer have to worry about that.

There are two types of blur, a standard Gaussian and an exponential, this allows you to get a more intense wrap around the edges with nice falloff, as well as softer colour bleed similar to the standard lightwrap node.
