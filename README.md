## LightWrap_GQ

This is my own custom light wrap node, I find the default node frustrating as if often messes with other channels if used directly in the main pipe. My node only affects the RGB channels so you no longer have to worry about that.


There are also two types of blur, a standard soft Gaussian and an exponential, this allows you to get a more intense wrap around the edges with nice falloff, as well as softer colour bleed you can get with the standard lightwrap node
